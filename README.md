# CPU Scheduling Simulator

## Project Description
This project implements and compares multiple CPU scheduling algorithms as part of CS 3502 at Kennesaw State University.

## Algorithms Implemented
- First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin (RR)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) [NEW]
- Multi-Level Feedback Queue (MLFQ) [NEW]

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Open in Visual Studio
3. Build and run the project
4. Enter number of processes and test different algorithms

## Modifications from Starter Code
- Added SRTF and MLFQ algorithms
- Refactored all algorithms to use Process class consistently
- Enhanced performance metrics collection
